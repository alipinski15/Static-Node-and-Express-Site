# Static Node and Express Site
 
In this project, I have create a gorgeous portfolio site to showcase the great projects I've built. The site contains a modern landing page, an about page where I have shared contact info and a brief Bio, and a series of project pages to show off and detail my projects from this Techdegree.

I have created a JSON file to store all the data about the projects I've created.

I have used Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is displayed in the browser.

I have utilized Node.js and Express to:

    Import the required dependencies
    Link the JSON with the Pug templates
    Set up routes to handle requests
    Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
    Handle errors
    Set up a server to serve the project

As an added Exceeds requirement I have added the following:

    Added the npm start to my package.json
    Created an Error page to handle whats displayed in the event of an error being thrown. 
    And created my own CSS stylesheet for customized CSS styling called mystyle.css
